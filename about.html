        <p>Madeline hates the coronavirus as much as the rest of us.</p>
        <h2>Backstory!</h2>
        <p>I grew up in an era where getting sick didn't mean anything. I went to school with coughs and chills and fevers well above safe temperatures. I turned out okay..or did I? I dropped out of college and am now a web developer, so you tell me.</p>
        <h2>The Coors Crisis</h2>
        <p>I don't have to go to my day job anymore. In fact, I don't have to go anywhere anymore. My doctors, my hair stylist, my tattoo artist, my snake food salesman, they all cancelled my appointments, and now I am stuck rustling mice from the shed in the backyard. OFF TOPIC. Anyways. Point is I have lots of time on my hands and I'm sure you do too.</p>
        <h2>Inception</h2>
        <p>I was eating dinner one night, and that's when I had a dream within a dream within an alcohol-induced hallucination: What if there was a place where I could find funny animal pictures, new shows to watch, new recipes to try, and hilarious jokes ALL IN ONE PLACE. And thus, the idea for The Isolation Station was born.</p>
        <h2>Evolution</h2>
        <p>My hopes for the future of my html-baby is total irrelevance due to this being the last pandemic that ever occurs. But, who am I kidding? You introverted walnuts are gonna self-isolate long after this thing is over, thus ruining any chance I had of achieving my dream.</p>

        <h2>Your Thoughts</h2>
        <p>Now that we've heard from our sponsor (ME...I am currently paying off good money for this macbook), we'd like to hear from you.</p>
        <p>Tell us how we did! No need to be gentle, in self-isolation there is no one around to hear you crying in the bathroom.</p>
